#  Quiz Game (Java Console Project)

## Overview
This is a **menu-driven Quiz Game** built in Java using Object-Oriented Programming concepts.  
The project allows users to:
- Create their own quiz by entering questions, options, and correct answers
- Play the quiz and get real-time scoring
- Save scores to a file for persistence
- View a **Leaderboard (Top 5 players)** with highest scores

This project demonstrates the use of **Java OOP, Collections, File Handling, and Input Handling**.
